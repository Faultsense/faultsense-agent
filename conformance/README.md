# Layer 2 — Per-framework conformance harnesses

Layer 2 of the cross-stack conformance strategy. Drivers under this directory run real framework apps in a real browser (Chromium via Playwright) and verify that every assertion in the catalog resolves end-to-end. If a driver surfaces a bug Layer 1 didn't predict, the workflow is to extract the mutation pattern class, lock it into Layer 1 as a new `PAT-NN`, and then fix the agent.

The Layer 1 pattern suite lives at [`tests/conformance/`](../tests/conformance/) — each `pat-NN-*.test.ts` file locks in a single mutation pattern class in jsdom. Layer 2 (this directory) provides the real-browser counterpart.

## Running

```bash
# One-time: install the Chromium build Playwright uses.
npm run conformance:install

# One-time per Node harness: install its own devDeps.
(cd conformance/react  && npm install)
(cd conformance/vue3   && npm install)
(cd conformance/svelte && npm install)
(cd conformance/solid  && npm install)
(cd conformance/alpine && npm install)
(cd conformance/astro  && npm install)
(cd conformance/htmx   && npm install)

# One-time per Docker harness: build the image. Playwright will also
# auto-build on first run, but doing this upfront keeps the first
# `npm run conformance` from blocking on several minutes of image build.
docker compose -f conformance/hotwire/docker-compose.yml  build
docker compose -f conformance/livewire/docker-compose.yml build
docker compose -f conformance/liveview/docker-compose.yml build

# One-time for the Rails harness: build the Docker image. Playwright
# will also auto-build on first run, but doing it upfront keeps the
# first `npm run conformance` from blocking on a 5-minute image build.
docker compose -f conformance/hotwire/docker-compose.yml build

# Run every driver.
npm run conformance

# Run a single framework.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** for every JavaScript harness (`react`, `vue3`, `svelte`, `solid`, `alpine`, `astro`, `htmx`). No additional setup beyond `npm install` in each harness directory.
- **Docker + Docker Compose** for the polyglot harnesses (`hotwire`, `livewire`, `liveview`). No native Ruby/PHP/Elixir install on the host — everything runs inside its own language's slim base image. Contributors without Docker can skip them with `--project=react --project=vue3 --project=svelte --project=solid --project=alpine --project=astro --project=htmx`.

### Suggested CI workflow

The repo does not currently have a `.github/workflows/` directory. When you're ready to wire Layer 2 into CI, the following workflow runs Layer 1 and all 10 Layer 2 harnesses (7 Node-backed + 3 Docker-backed) with per-toolchain caching. GitHub Actions ships with Docker + Buildx preinstalled on `ubuntu-latest`, so the three polyglot harnesses (hotwire/livewire/liveview) boot via `docker compose` without extra setup steps — their own Dockerfiles bring Ruby/PHP/Elixir in:

```yaml

          set: |
            *.cache-from=type=gha
            *.cache-to=type=gha,mode=max
      - name: Cache Playwright browsers
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright
          key: playwright-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
      - run: npm run conformance:install
      - run: npm run conformance
      # `conformance:matrix` is a pure generator — reads
      # test-results/results.json, writes the rendered matrix to
      # stdout (or the optional output-file positional arg).
      - run: npm run conformance:matrix -- works-with.md
      - name: Upload works-with snapshot
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with: { name: works-with, path: works-with.md }
      - name: Fail if the committed matrix drifted
        run: git diff --exit-code works-with.md
```

The final step is the interesting one: it fails CI if the regenerated matrix doesn't match the committed snapshot, which forces contributors to re-run the generator whenever they add a scenario or harness. No matrix drift.

### `conformance/` vs `examples/` — who owns what

`conformance/` is where Layer 2 lives. Every harness is purpose-built minimal: one page, one driver, 8–10 focused scenarios, one webServer entry in `playwright.config.ts`. Harnesses are regression infrastructure — they stay stable so the matrix stays meaningful.

`examples/` is where the human-facing demos live. `examples/todolist-tanstack/` is a full TanStack Start + React 19 app with auth, routing, offline banner, activity log, and the panel collector overlay. `examples/todolist-htmx/` is an Express + EJS + HTMX 2 app of similar scope. These exist for marketing, onboarding, and manual exploration. **They are not driven by the conformance suite** — polish them freely, animate them, restyle them; the conformance tests will not break.

When you want to know "how do I instrument a real Vue 3 app?", read `conformance/vue3/src/App.vue` for the minimal form. When you want to show a prospect what Faultsense looks like in a polished app, point them at `examples/todolist-tanstack/`.

`npm run conformance` is NOT wired into `npm test`. Layer 1 (jsdom) stays fast; Layer 2 boots real dev servers and takes longer. CI runs both as parallel jobs.

### Shared scenario runners

Every driver is a thin wrapper around `conformance/shared/runners.ts`. Each driver declares a `HarnessConfig` (name, settle wait, toggle selector/action, expected assertion types, backend reset hook) and registers one `test()` per supported scenario that delegates the body to `runners[scenarioKey](page, config)`. Framework-specific variance — Hotwire's `.toggle-btn` vs React's checkbox, HTMX's `"updated"` toggle assertion type vs Hotwire's `"added"` — lives in the config, not duplicated across drivers.

`conformance/shared/scenarios.js` is the single source of truth for scenario keys and their PAT-NN mappings. Both the Node matrix generator and the TypeScript drivers import it. Adding a new scenario is a one-file change to that registry; the drift guards in the matrix generator fail loudly if a driver runs a scenario key that isn't registered.

## How the in-page collector works

Each harness loads `conformance/shared/collector.js` before the Faultsense agent script. The collector registers `window.Faultsense.collectors.conformance`, which the agent resolves by name via `data-collector-url="conformance"` on its own script tag (see [`src/index.ts:151-161`](../src/index.ts#L151)).

Assertions are JSON-cloned on capture so post-settlement mutations (invariant auto-retry, sibling dismissal) don't corrupt the recorded snapshot. Drivers read them with `await page.evaluate(() => window.__fsAssertions)` — the `readCapturedAssertions` / `waitForFsAssertion` helpers wrap that pattern.

## Reusing the existing example apps

The tanstack and htmx harnesses reuse `examples/todolist-*` in place. The only change inside `examples/` is a collector-mode switch driven by a build-time environment variable: the demo default is the panel collector; `VITE_FS_COLLECTOR=conformance npm run dev` flips the root layout to load `collector.js` and set `data-collector-url="conformance"`. Playwright's `webServer` entry sets the env var when it spawns the dev server, so the demo UX is unchanged for humans.

## Adding a new framework harness

1. Scaffold the harness under `conformance/<framework>/` using that framework's natural backend. HTMX and React are language-agnostic; **Hotwire must use Rails, Livewire must use Laravel, LiveView must use Phoenix** — the harness needs to exercise the framework's actual DOM patching machinery, not a JS-only re-implementation of it.
2. Load `../../shared/collector.js` (or a symlink in the harness's public directory) before the agent script tag in the harness's layout. Use `data-collector-url="conformance"` on the agent script.
3. Add a `webServer` entry to `playwright.config.ts` pointing at the harness's dev-server command and a dedicated port.
4. Add a project entry alongside the existing ones in the same file.
5. Add `drivers/<framework>.spec.ts` using the helpers in `shared/assertions.ts`. Reuse test names across drivers so the Phase 6 matrix generator can correlate results.
6. If the harness uses a native toolchain (Ruby for Rails, PHP for Laravel, Elixir for Phoenix), document the prerequisites here and add the corresponding `setup-*` action to the CI workflow.

## Skipping polyglot harnesses locally

Contributors without Docker can still run Layer 1 and every Node-only harness. Skip the three Docker-backed harnesses (hotwire, livewire, liveview) explicitly:

```bash
npm run conformance -- \
  --project=react --project=vue3 --project=svelte --project=solid \
  --project=alpine --project=astro --project=htmx
```

CI installs Docker on demand and boots each polyglot container there, so the full matrix always runs on the main branch.
